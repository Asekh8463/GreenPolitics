<br> <br> GreenPolitics is a 39-question test that will try to tell you what kind of environmentalist you are based on 5 policies.<br></p> <p style="font-size:30px"><b><u>Read before starting:</u></b></p><br> <p>This test will not work for you if you are a climate sceptic (read: straw-for-brains lunatic).<br> <br>
In this test I've used the terms "organizations" to refer to a non-governmental group of people fighintg climate change, and the term "fossil fuel" to refer to any non-renewable resource such as oil, gas, and coal.<br><br></p>
